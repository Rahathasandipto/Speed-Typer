                <p class="container">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
                    localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever
                    a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                    assigned to that particular tab. <br>
                    <strong>Local storage </strong> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data
                    to be stored, but
                    the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that
                    the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
                    <br>
                    <strong> Session storage</strong> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current
                    session. This
                    means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for
                    storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.

                <p class="container">Global scope variables can use within the program anyware. Global variables are
                    declaring outside any functions. Local scope variable value is only for that particular scope
                    (function). Local variables are declaring inside that particular function.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Global scope</strong>
                    In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all
                    other scopes.
                    In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which all the code is
                    being executed.
                    <br>
                    <strong> Local scope</strong>
                    Local scope is a characteristic of variables that makes them local (i.e., the variable name is only
                    bound to its value within a scope which is not the global scope).

                    JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                    collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                    models in other languages like C and Java.
                    Runtime concepts
                    The following sections explain a theoretical model. Modern JavaScript engines implement and heavily
                    optimize the described semantics.

                    The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's
                    primitive types.
                    <br>
                    <strong>When we can get undefined property?</strong><br>
                    You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the
                    above example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted
                    value to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.
                    <strong>What is the undefined value?</strong>
                    <br>
                    undefined() is an ECMAScript1 (ES1) feature.
                    The undefined value is a special value used in some places to specify an absence of information. For
                    example, accessing a property of a value which is not defined, or a local variable which has been
                    declared but not initialized, yields the undefined value.
